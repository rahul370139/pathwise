# PathWise — Backend Architecture

This doc is the source of truth for what runs where, what data moves between modules, and how the three product surfaces (Learn, Career, Dashboard) are wired. Read this before adding a new endpoint or model.

Key design choices that follow from this diagram:

- **One generation path for the Learn page.** Every Quick Action button (summary, lesson, quiz, flashcards, workflow, diagnostic) goes through `/api/chat → distiller.process_chat_message`. There is no separate `/api/agent/{kind}` endpoint any more — they were placeholder content and divergent from production prompts.
- **RAG is opt-in by absence of PDF.** When the user has not uploaded a document, `process_chat_message` automatically retrieves from the `interview_prep_kb` Supabase table and pipes it in as the same `file_context` that PDF chunks would have populated. This means quizzes / lessons / workflows about technical topics ("what is RAG?", "explain transformers") work without an upload.
- **Career upgrade is its own pipeline.** Resume parsing → skill-gap → plan generation lives in `resume_career.py` so the career page does not depend on the chat machinery and a future migration (e.g. switching to a fine-tuned skill-gap model) only changes one file.
- **Mastery is the only persisted user-progress signal we trust.** Diagnostic submissions write to `mastery.py → supabase_helper`; the dashboard reads from there.

## 2. Learn page — request flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant FE as unified-ai-interface.tsx
    participant API as /api/chat
    participant D as distiller.process_chat_message
    participant RAG as rag_kb.retrieve_kb
    participant G as Groq (llama-3.3-70b)
    participant C as Cohere embed

    U->>FE: clicks "Generate quiz"
    FE->>API: POST /api/chat { message: "Generate quiz" }
    API->>D: process_chat_message
    alt PDF chunks already in conversation
        D->>D: top-k retrieval over conv chunks
    else No PDF context
        D->>C: embed(message)
        D->>RAG: match_interview_prep(query_embedding, k=6)
        RAG-->>D: top-k KB chunks
        D->>D: store as file_context
    end
    D->>G: prompt(grounded by retrieval, JSON-only)
    G-->>D: { questions: [...] }
    D-->>API: ChatResponse(type="quiz", quiz_data)
    API-->>FE: JSON
    FE->>FE: parseAPIResponse → renders QuizComponent
```

Everything the user sees on the Learn page comes out of one of these handlers in `distiller.py`:

| Intent           | Handler                          | Output type      | Frontend renderer      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| summary          | `_handle_summary_generation`     | `summary`        | `SummaryComponent`     |
| lesson           | `_handle_lesson_generation`      | `lesson`         | `LessonComponent`      |
| quiz             | `_handle_quiz_generation`        | `quiz`           | `QuizComponent`        |
| flashcards       | `_handle_flashcard_generation`   | `flashcards`     | `FlashcardsComponent`  |
| workflow         | `_handle_workflow_generation`    | `workflow`       | `WorkflowComponent`    |
| diagnostic       | `_handle_diagnostic_generation`  | `diagnostic`     | `DiagnosticComponent`  |
| anything else    | `_handle_regular_chat`           | `text`           | plain text bubble      |

The intent dispatcher is purely keyword-based at the top of `process_chat_message` — small, debuggable, and fast.

## 3. Career page — resume → upgrade plan

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant FE as resume-career-upgrade.tsx
    participant P as /api/career/resume/parse
    participant B as /api/career/plan/build
    participant RC as resume_career.py
    participant CM as career_matcher.matcher.career_data (O*NET)
    participant G as Groq

    U->>FE: upload resume.pdf
    FE->>P: POST file
    P->>RC: parse_resume(path)
    RC->>RC: pdf_to_text + truncate
    RC->>G: extract structured profile (JSON)
    G-->>RC: { skills, experience, projects, education }
    RC-->>P: parsed
    P-->>FE: { resume }
    Note over FE: skills auto-fill, user picks target role + interests

    U->>FE: clicks "Build my upgrade plan"
    FE->>B: POST { resume, target_role, interests }
    B->>RC: build_career_plan
    RC->>CM: _find_onet_row(target_role)
    CM-->>RC: O*NET row (salary, growth, top_skills)
    RC->>G: skill-gap + roadmap + 90-day plan + projects (JSON)
    G-->>RC: plan
    RC->>RC: stitch O*NET salary band into market_insights
    RC-->>B: { onet_match, plan }
    B-->>FE: plan
    FE->>FE: PlanView renders gap, 3-stage roadmap, 90-day plan, projects
```

Why a single `build_career_plan` LLM call instead of three sequential ones:

- One Groq round trip is ~3× cheaper than three.
- The model produces more coherent output when it sees the gap analysis and the plan it's writing for in the same context window.
- Failure modes are easier to reason about — we only need to validate one JSON.

The `_find_onet_row` lookup uses three fallbacks (exact title → substring → word-overlap score) so even unusual target roles (e.g. "MLOps Engineer", which isn't in O*NET verbatim) still anchor to a credible row instead of returning nothing.

## 4. RAG: how embeddings actually work in Supabase

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph IngestTime["Ingest time (one-shot CLI)"]
        MD[interview_prep/*.md]
        CK[chunk_markdown<br/>1800 char windows<br/>250 char overlap]
        EMB1[Cohere embed-english-light-v3<br/>384-dim]
        UP[supabase upsert<br/>on chunk_hash]
        TBL[(interview_prep_kb<br/>id · doc · section · chunk · embedding vector(384))]
        IDX[ivfflat index<br/>vector_cosine_ops]
        MD --> CK --> EMB1 --> UP --> TBL
        TBL --> IDX
    end

    subgraph QueryTime["Query time (every chat without a PDF)"]
        Q[user message]
        EMB2[Cohere embed query]
        RPC[match_interview_prep RPC<br/>1 - cosine_distance]
        TOP[top-6 chunks]
        Q --> EMB2 --> RPC --> TOP
        IDX -. ANN search .-> RPC
    end

    TOP --> CTX[file_context for LLM prompt]
```

### Supabase schema

```sql
create extension if not exists vector;

create table interview_prep_kb (
  id            bigserial primary key,
  doc           text not null,
  section       text,
  chunk         text not null,
  chunk_hash    text not null unique,
  embedding     vector(384),
  created_at    timestamptz default now()
);

create index interview_prep_kb_embedding_idx
  on interview_prep_kb using ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
  with (lists = 100);

create or replace function match_interview_prep(
  query_embedding vector(384),
  match_count int default 6
)
returns table (id bigint, doc text, section text, chunk text, similarity float)
language sql stable
as $$
  select id, doc, section, chunk,
         1 - (embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity
  from interview_prep_kb
  where embedding is not null
  order by embedding <=> query_embedding
  limit match_count;
$$;
```

The full migration is in `backend/migrations/20260506_interview_prep_kb.sql`.

### Why these specific choices

- **`vector(384)`** because Cohere `embed-english-light-v3.0` produces 384-dim vectors. We deliberately use the same model `distiller.py` already uses so query embeddings are interchangeable between PDF chunks and the KB.
- **`chunk_hash` UNIQUE** makes ingestion idempotent. Re-running `python -m rag_kb ingest …` after editing one markdown file only re-embeds the changed chunks.
- **IVFFlat with `lists=100`** is the right setting for a few-thousand-row table. If the corpus grows past ~50k chunks, switch to `hnsw` (also supported by pgvector) without changing the rest of the stack.
- **Server-side RPC `match_interview_prep`** does the cosine search inside Postgres so the backend only ships back the top-k. Falling back to a client-side cosine scan is implemented in `rag_kb.retrieve_kb` for the case where the RPC isn't installed.

### One-time setup

```bash
# 1. Apply the migration in Supabase Studio
#    https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<ref>/sql
#    Paste backend/migrations/20260506_interview_prep_kb.sql → Run

# 2. Run the end-to-end smoke test (verifies env, Cohere, table, ingest, retrieval)
cd backend
python -m scripts.test_rag                # full run
python -m scripts.test_rag --skip-ingest  # dry-run, useful in CI

# 3. Or use the stand-alone CLI
python -m rag_kb ingest "/path/to/interview_prep"
python -m rag_kb query "what is rag"
```

If the table is missing, `scripts/test_rag.py` prints the SQL inline and a direct link to the SQL editor for your project so you can copy-paste in <30 seconds.

## 7. Environment

```
GROQ_API_KEY=…                       # Llama-3.3-70b inference (used in distiller, resume_career)
COHERE_API_KEY=…                     # embed-english-light-v3 (PDF chunks + KB + career embeddings)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=…           # used by both frontend and backend
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=…      # row-level-secured public key
# Optional:
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=…          # if RLS prevents the anon key from upserting into interview_prep_kb
```

If you maintain a second Supabase project specifically for the RAG KB, point the backend at it via `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` before running the ingest CLI. The lessons / cards / users tables can stay in either project — `supabase_helper.py` reads the same env vars.

## 8. Operational checklist

When adding a new content type for the Learn page:

1. Add a `_handle_<kind>_generation` in `distiller.py`.
2. Wire it into the intent dispatcher near the top of `process_chat_message`.
3. The handler MUST set `type` in its return payload, and put the structured payload under a `<kind>_data` key (mirroring the existing handlers).
4. On the frontend, extend `parseAPIResponse` in `unified-ai-interface.tsx` and add a `<kind>Component` to render it.
5. Do **not** add a new `/api/agent/<kind>` route — we deleted those for a reason.

When changing the RAG corpus:

1. Drop new markdown into `interview_prep/`.
2. Re-run `python -m rag_kb ingest …`. Idempotency comes from `chunk_hash`.
3. Spot-check with `python -m rag_kb query "<question>"`.

When touching resume-driven plan persistence:

1. `POST /api/career/plan/snapshot` writes the latest plan JSON per user.
2. `GET /api/career/plan/latest/{user_id}` is the read path used by dashboard.
3. `POST /api/career/upgrade` can persist automatically when `user_id` query param is provided.

When changing the embedding model:

1. Update `cohere_embed` in `distiller.py`.
2. Update `vector(N)` in `migrations/…interview_prep_kb.sql`, and re-create the table (drop + migrate).
3. Re-ingest the entire corpus — old vectors are not comparable to new ones.
