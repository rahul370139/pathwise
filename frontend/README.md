## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- pnpm package manager
- Supabase account for backend services
- OpenAI API key for AI features

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pathwise.git

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
# Create `frontend/.env.local` (Next.js reads this automatically in dev)

# Run development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build
```

### Environment Variables

See `frontend/.env.example` for the full checklist. Minimum for local dev:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
API_PROXY_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Production on Vercel also needs `API_PROXY_TARGET` pointing at your Hostinger backend, plus Supabase redirect URLs for `/auth/callback`.
